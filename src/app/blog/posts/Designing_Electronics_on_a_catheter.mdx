## Rethinking How Electronics Are Printed

Printing electronics on **3 mm diameter medical catheters** is not just challenging—it forces you to rethink motion control, deposition physics, and material behavior at micro-scales.

During my PhD, I built a **rotary 3D printing system** from the ground up using:

- A rotating print bed  
- A micro-dispensing print head  
- Real-time height correction using a Keyence confocal sensor  
- A C# GUI built using the Thorlabs Kinesis SDK  
- Custom G-code motion planning  

What started as an experiment has evolved into a platform for printing **strain sensors, temperature sensors, microheaters, chipless RFID, and even CNT/PEDOT:PSS composites**—all directly on curved, flexible surfaces.

## Precision in Motion Control

The biggest challenge wasn’t electronics—it was motion.

I needed sub-100-micron accuracy across rotation, X-axis travel, and Z-axis height.  
So I developed a motion pipeline that converts G-code into synchronized commands for:

- Rotary axis (θ)  
- Linear X  
- Vertical Z  

Here’s a small example of how coordinate parsing is handled:

<CodeBlock
  marginBottom="16"
  codes={[
    {
      code:
`const move = (line: string) => {
  const x = getCoord(line, "X");
  const z = getCoord(line, "Z");
  const r = getCoord(line, "R"); // rotary axis

  if (x !== null) stageX.MoveTo(x);
  if (z !== null) stageZ.MoveTo(z);
  if (r !== null) rotary.MoveTo(r);
};`,
      language: "tsx",
      label: "motion-control.ts"
    }
  ]}
/>

This system lets me print continuous serpentine traces on curved catheters without stretching, misalignment, or flow instability.

## Materials That Behave Differently on Curved Surfaces

Printing on a cylinder changes everything: viscosity, shear forces, curing, and wetting dynamics all shift.

Some examples:

- **CNT + Ecoflex** mixes behave nonlinearly under strain → perfect for soft strain sensors.  
- **CNT + PEDOT:PSS** composites show a negative TCR → ideal for temperature sensing.  
- **AgNP inks** provide low-resistance pathways for microheaters.  

Even tiny variations in nozzle-to-surface distance changed the outcome, which is why the **10 kHz confocal feedback loop** was essential.

## Applications That Inspired the System

The system wasn't built for a single device—it was built for an ecosystem of smart medical tools:

- Catheters with embedded **printed strain sensors** for mechanical feedback  
- Microheaters for **hyperthermia therapy** and **drug release**  
- Printed temperature sensors for **continuous thermal monitoring**  
- Passive RF components and **chipless RFID** for medical data tracing  
- Secure blockchain logging for lifecycle tracking  

This is what the future of minimally invasive medical electronics looks like.

## What’s Next

I'm extending the platform to support:

- Multi-material printing  
- Real-time AI-based motion correction  
- Automated electrical characterization  
- Implantable microfluidic channels with sensing layers  

I’ll share more technical deep-dives soon—including full breakdowns of the control algorithms, G-code interpreter, confocal feedback loop, and printing physics.
