## The Millimeter Problem

Everyone can design circuits on a PCB.  
But once you shrink everything onto a **3 mm flexible cylinder**, physics becomes a different animal.

At this scale:

- adhesives stop behaving like “glue”  
- conductors crack under tiny strain  
- fluid inks behave like unstable films  
- sensors need to bend without signal loss

This is why catheter electronics are still mostly *off-board*.

## How Nanotech Changes the Game

Modern nanomaterials allow us to print features that:

- stretch  
- bend  
- heal  
- maintain conductivity  
- interface with tissue  

Examples I actively use:

- **CNT + Ecoflex** → strain sensors  
- **CNT + PEDOT:PSS** → temperature layers  
- **AgNP inks** → microheater traces  
- **MXene** → future ideas for RF + sensing  
- **graphene inks** → ultra-thin biopotential electrodes  

These enable electronic performance that traditional metals on flex-PCB can’t match.

## Printing Sensors on Curved Surfaces

My rotary 3D printer solves four core challenges:

1. **Cylindrical coordinate motion**  
2. **Constant nozzle-to-surface distance**  
3. **Ink wetting control**  
4. **Real-time height feedback (10 kHz)**  

The result?  
Functional electronics printed directly onto medical devices.

This means sensors are no longer an “attached component.”  
They become the surface itself.

## Why This Matters

Microscale electronics on catheters unlock:

- real-time strain monitoring  
- thermal sensing  
- targeted heating  
- infection tracking  
- chipless RFID identity tags  
- closed-loop surgical tools  

We’re finally approaching a future where medical instruments sense the body as naturally as they move through it.
