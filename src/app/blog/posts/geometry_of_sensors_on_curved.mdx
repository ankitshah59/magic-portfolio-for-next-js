## Flat Sensors Don’t Behave the Same on Curved Bodies

Most sensor physics is derived assuming flat surfaces.

But on a catheter:

- curvature introduces non-linear strain  
- radial displacement creates tension gradients  
- material thickness changes bending stiffness  
- fluid inks experience asymmetric shear  

So even printing a **straight line** becomes a mathematical challenge.

## Serpentine Designs Aren’t Just Aesthetic

A serpentine trace has two advantages:

1. **Distributed strain absorption**  
2. **Out-of-plane compliance**

On a straight catheter, the strain field is actually *elliptical* when bent.  
Serpentine traces naturally unfold to handle this.

## Thermal Sensors on Curved Geometries

CNT + PEDOT:PSS layers show negative TCR.  
But curvature changes:

- film thickness  
- contact area  
- percolation pathways  

This means the sensor’s thermal sensitivity varies with catheter diameter.

You compensate with:

- controlled print height  
- matched ink viscosity  
- uniform post-curing  

## Why This Matters for Medical Robots

Robotic catheters need built-in sensing:

- tactile feedback  
- shape sensing  
- thermal mapping  
- self-localization  

Curved-surface electronics is the key to making them real.
