Wearables pack *a full computer* into a space smaller than a coin.  
With SoCs like the **nRF52840**, every millimeter of layout matters.

Here’s how I approach designing rigid–flex boards for rings, straps, catheters, and medical wearables.

## Why Rigid–Flex?

Rigid–flex offers:

- **Rigid area** = MCU, power, radio  
- **Flex area** = sensors, antenna, LEDs  
- Bend radius matching your form factor  
- Minimal wiring  
- Shock resistance  

For wearable applications, it’s not optional — it’s essential.

## nRF52840: Perfect for Wearables

- BLE 5.2  
- 2.4 GHz radio with excellent sensitivity  
- ARM Cortex-M4F processor  
- USB, I²C, SPI, UART  
- Extremely low power consumption  

The chip delivers powerful processing while remaining battery-friendly.

## Altium Tips for Rigid–Flex Wearables

### 1. Define Layer Stacks Early

Typical stacks I use:

- **Rigid**: 4 layers  
- **Flex**: 2 layers (PI substrate)  

Keep copper thin in flex regions to allow smooth bending.

### 2. Separate Digital and RF Zones

For optimal radio performance:

- Keep radio section away from switching regulators  
- Avoid ground voids  
- Match traces to the antenna feed  

### 3. Antenna Choice Matters

Options for tiny wearables:

- Meandered inverted-F antenna (MIFA)  
- Chip antenna (e.g., Johanson, 2.4 GHz)  
- Flex antenna  

Always tune with a **Pi matching network**.

### 4. Flex Trace Rules

- Use curved traces  
- Avoid vias where possible  
- Stagger pads  
- Maintain 45° trace transitions  

### 5. Battery and Power Management

Small Li-ion or LiPo battery with:

- BQ2407x charger  
- TPS62740 buck converter (if needed)  

Optimized sleep mode can yield **weeks of runtime**.

## Typical Wearable Architecture

<CodeBlock
  codes={[{
    code:
`nRF52840 SoC
|-- BLE
|-- 3x IMU
|-- PPG or temperature sensor
|-- Flex antenna
|-- Battery + charger`,
    language: "txt",
    label: "wearable-architecture"
  }]}
/>

## Final Thoughts

Rigid–flex PCB design is engineering origami at its finest.  
Altium makes it surprisingly intuitive once you understand bend regions, layer stacks, and RF hygiene.
