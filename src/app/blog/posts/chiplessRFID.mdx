## Why Hospitals Need Chipless Tracking

Every catheter has a lifecycle:

1. manufacturing  
2. sterilization  
3. transport  
4. procedure  
5. disposal  

Most hospitals track this manually.  
Which means mistakes happen.

Chipless RFID tags solve this with:

- no chips  
- no batteries  
- low cost  
- flexible geometries  
- anti-counterfeiting capability  

## My Tag Designs

I use **rectangular uniplanar resonators** with slit openings.

Each resonator → one notch in the frequency spectrum.  
Combined → a unique binary ID.

Even when the tag is:

- bent  
- twisted  
- partially stretched  
- printed on TPU  

…the ML pipeline still identifies the correct ID.

## The ML Decoder

The system uses:

- frequency dip extraction  
- SVM + MLP + k-NN classifiers  
- bent/distorted simulations  
- annotated predictions  
- confusion matrices  

Here’s a tiny part of the feature extraction logic:

<CodeBlock
  codes={[
    {
      code:
`def extract_notches(freq, mag):
    # find dips in the RCS response
    idx = signal.find_peaks(-mag, distance=50)[0]
    return freq[idx]`,
      language: "python",
      label: "features.py"
    }
  ]}
/>

## Why This Belongs in Healthcare

With chipless RFID:

- every catheter has a digital identity  
- every event is logged to blockchain  
- hospitals get traceability  
- patients get safer procedures  

It's small tech — but big impact.
