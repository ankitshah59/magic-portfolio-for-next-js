Most hardware engineers struggle more with **GUIs** than with electronics.

I’ve built dozens of:

- Sensor dashboards  
- Robotics control panels  
- Medical device UIs  
- Serial/BLE interfaces  
- Custom software for printers & lab tools  

Here’s the framework selection guide I personally use.

## Desktop GUIs (Lab Equipment, CNC, Robots)

**Tkinter (Python)**  
- Easiest to get started  
- Great for students  
- Functional, not flashy  

**PyQt / PySide**  
- Professional-grade  
- Cross-platform  
- Perfect for instrument control  

**Electron or Tauri**  
- Modern, web-style desktop apps  
- Ideal for polished UIs  

**C# WinForms / WPF**  
- Best for hardware via USB/serial  
- Works with Kinesis SDK, NI devices, lab instruments  
- I personally used **C# + WPF** for my rotary 3D printer GUI  

## Mobile GUIs (Wearable Dashboards, BLE Control)

- **React Native** → Fast to build, great BLE libraries  
- **SwiftUI** → Best UX for iPhone-only apps  
- **Android Studio (Kotlin)** → Full hardware API access  

Use mobile apps when your device communicates via:

- BLE  
- WiFi  
- NFC  
- Cloud APIs  

## Web GUIs (Dashboards, ML Analytics, Logging)

- **React + Next.js** → Ideal for dashboards, easy chart integration  
- **SvelteKit** → Extremely fast, lightweight  
- **Streamlit / Gradio** → Rapid ML prototypes, build UIs in minutes  

Web dashboards excel at visualizing sensor data, like RFID signals, strain sensors, or microheater curves.

## Embedded GUIs (On-Device Screens)

Use for small TFT/OLED displays:

- **LVGL (C/C++)**  
- **LittlevGL**  
- **TouchGFX**  

These frameworks provide a “consumer-device” feel on microcontrollers.

## My Recommendations by Project

| Project Type             | Best GUI                  |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Custom 3D printer         | C# WPF / Qt              |
| Sensor streaming          | Python + PyQt            |
| Medical dashboard         | React / Next.js          |
| Wearable companion app    | React Native             |
| Production robotics       | C# / C++                 |
| Quick ML prototype        | Streamlit / Gradio       |
| On-device UI              | LVGL                     |

## Final Thoughts

Choose a GUI framework based on:

- Your hardware interface  
- Deployment platform  
- Speed of development  
- Visual requirements  

Good UIs aren’t about beauty — they’re about *clarity* and *control*.  
Don’t overthink it; pick the tool that lets you iterate quickly.
