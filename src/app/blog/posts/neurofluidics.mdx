## Combining Two Worlds

Microfluidics gives precise chemical control.  
Electronics gives precise sensing and stimulation.

Merging them creates **neurofluidics** — a field that barely exists today.

## What a Neurofluidic Implant Might Look Like

Imagine a thread-like implant that can:

- sense local neural temperature  
- monitor biochemical markers  
- deliver micro-doses of drugs  
- stimulate neurons electrically  
- log data wirelessly  

All autonomously.

My current catheter work is basically the gateway technology for this.

## The Technical Stack

Such an implant would require:

- CNT-based nanosensors  
- soft microfluidic channels  
- microheaters for controlled release  
- graphene electrodes for stimulation  
- chipless RFID for identity  
- AI-based physiological modeling  

Every part is challenging — but none are impossible.

## Why It Excites Me

This is where:

- printed electronics  
- microfluidics  
- neuroscience  
- robotics  
- sensing  
- AI  

…all converge.

Neurofluidics could unlock new treatments for:

- epilepsy  
- inflammation  
- hydrocephalus  
- neurodegeneration  
- targeted drug delivery  

It’s the direction I want my long-term research to evolve toward.
