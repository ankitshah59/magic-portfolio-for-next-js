**Clinical Research Project** • *SWOTA Conference 2019*

## Executive Summary

The Smart Pedicle Probe is a wireless intelligent surgical instrument designed to assist surgeons during spine surgery by providing real-time force, torque, and orientation feedback during pedicle screw placement. The system integrates high-precision sensors with intuitive software interfaces to prevent one of the most serious complications in spinal surgery: inadvertent penetration of the spinal canal and injury to the spinal cord. By combining multimodal sensing with immediate audio-visual guidance, the Smart Pedicle Probe transforms a technically demanding procedure into a safer, more controlled operation.

💡 **Key Innovation**: First wireless pedicle probe with integrated force, torque, and orientation sensing providing real-time corrective guidance through synchronized audio alerts and visual feedback, specifically designed for cervical spine procedures at the challenging C4-C5 vertebral levels.

## The Clinical Problem

Pedicle screw fixation is one of the most common procedures in spinal surgery, used to stabilize the spine after trauma, correct deformities like scoliosis, or provide support during spinal fusion operations. The procedure involves drilling a pathway through the pedicle—a small bony projection connecting the vertebral body to the posterior elements—and inserting a screw to anchor instrumentation. While this technique has revolutionized spinal surgery and improved outcomes for millions of patients, it carries significant risks. The pedicle creates a narrow corridor of safe passage, typically only 4 to 8 millimeters in diameter depending on the vertebral level and patient anatomy. On one side of this corridor lies the spinal canal containing the spinal cord and nerve roots; on the other side lie major blood vessels. A breach in either direction can result in catastrophic complications including paralysis, severe nerve damage, vascular injury, or chronic pain.

The challenge becomes particularly acute in the cervical spine, especially at the C4 and C5 vertebral levels. The cervical pedicles are significantly smaller than their lumbar counterparts, often measuring just 4 to 5 millimeters in diameter. The spinal cord occupies a larger proportion of the spinal canal in the neck compared to the lower back, leaving less margin for error. The angle of approach is critical—even a few degrees of deviation from the optimal trajectory can result in the probe breaking through the medial wall into the spinal canal or perforating the lateral cortex into the surrounding soft tissues. Traditional surgical techniques rely heavily on anatomical landmarks, tactile feedback, and the surgeon's experience to guide probe placement. However, anatomical variations between patients, osteoporotic bone that provides less tactile feedback, and limited visualization in minimally invasive approaches all contribute to reported breach rates ranging from 5 to 40 percent in various studies, though most breaches are minor and asymptomatic.

Fluoroscopy and navigation systems have improved accuracy, but they primarily provide positional information without conveying the mechanical forces at play. A surgeon might be on the correct trajectory but applying excessive force, risking sudden breakthrough into sensitive structures. Conversely, insufficient force might result in incomplete probe advancement, requiring multiple attempts that increase tissue trauma and operative time. The lack of quantitative force feedback and real-time orientation correction represents a significant gap in current surgical technology. Surgeons need a tool that not only tells them where the probe is located but also how hard they're pushing, whether they're torquing the instrument, and most importantly, whether they're deviating from the safe trajectory before a breach occurs.

## The Smart Pedicle Probe Solution

The Smart Pedicle Probe addresses these challenges through a compact, wireless surgical instrument that seamlessly integrates into existing surgical workflows while providing unprecedented levels of feedback and guidance. The probe features a familiar ergonomic design that feels natural in a surgeon's hand, maintaining the tactile connection to the surgical field that experienced surgeons value. However, embedded within this familiar form factor is sophisticated sensor technology that continuously monitors three critical parameters: the axial force being applied along the probe's length, the torque or twisting force being exerted, and the three-dimensional orientation of the probe relative to the patient's anatomy.

The force and torque measurements come from a FUTEK miniature multi-axis sensor positioned at the probe's shaft. This sensor uses strain gauge technology to detect even subtle changes in applied forces, with resolution sufficient to distinguish between different bone densities and detect the transition from hard cortical bone to softer cancellous bone. The sensor can measure forces up to 200 Newtons (approximately 45 pounds) and torques up to 2 Newton-meters, ranges that encompass the typical forces used in pedicle preparation while providing headroom to detect excessive force application. The sensor outputs analog signals at high frequency, allowing the system to detect rapid force changes that might indicate sudden breakthrough events.

Orientation tracking employs a 9-axis inertial measurement unit that combines accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers to determine the probe's spatial orientation in real-time. This sensor fusion approach provides absolute orientation with accuracy better than 2 degrees across all axes. The system establishes a reference frame based on the patient's anatomy at the start of the procedure—typically aligned with the vertebral body's superior-inferior, medial-lateral, and anterior-posterior axes. As the surgeon advances the probe, the orientation sensor continuously compares the current trajectory to the planned safe corridor. Deviations are detected immediately, triggering corrective guidance before the probe tip reaches the pedicle wall.

Power management presented a unique challenge given the sterile field requirements and the need for untethered operation. The probe incorporates a compact lithium-ion battery that provides more than 4 hours of continuous operation, far exceeding the typical duration of pedicle screw placement even in complex multi-level procedures. The battery module is sealed and autoclavable, allowing the entire probe to be sterilized between cases using standard hospital protocols. A magnetic charging dock enables convenient recharging without compromising the waterproof seal—the probe simply rests in the dock between surgeries, ensuring it's always ready for the next case.

Wireless data transmission uses Bluetooth Low Energy technology to stream sensor data to a nearby computer or tablet at 100 Hertz, providing smooth real-time updates without perceptible lag. The wireless protocol includes error checking and automatic retry mechanisms to ensure data integrity even in the electrically noisy operating room environment with cautery devices, fluoroscopy equipment, and other electronic instruments. The compact electronics package fits entirely within the probe's handle, maintaining a balanced weight distribution that doesn't fatigue the surgeon's hand during extended procedures.

## Multi-Modal Feedback and Guidance System

The true innovation of the Smart Pedicle Probe lies not just in the sensors themselves but in how the data is processed and communicated to the surgeon in real-time. The system employs a multi-modal feedback approach that leverages both visual and auditory channels, recognizing that surgeons' visual attention is primarily focused on the surgical field and fluoroscopy monitors. The desktop software application displays a comprehensive dashboard showing force magnitude, torque levels, and a three-dimensional representation of the probe's current orientation overlaid on the planned trajectory. Color-coded zones indicate safe operating ranges—green for optimal parameters, yellow for approaching limits, and red for dangerous conditions. Trend graphs show the history of forces over the past several seconds, helping surgeons recognize patterns associated with different tissue layers.

However, the most immediately actionable feedback comes through the audio guidance system. The probe emits carefully designed audio cues that convey critical information without requiring the surgeon to look away from the surgical field. A continuous low-frequency tone indicates normal operation within safe parameters. As applied force approaches the upper limit of the recommended range, the tone increases in pitch, providing intuitive feedback that the surgeon is pushing too hard. If the probe orientation deviates from the planned trajectory by more than 5 degrees, a distinct rhythmic beeping begins, with the beep frequency increasing as the angular error grows larger. The direction of required correction is conveyed through stereo audio—if the probe needs to angle more medially, the beeping is louder in the left ear; lateral corrections are indicated by right-sided emphasis. This spatial audio cueing allows surgeons to make continuous micro-adjustments to their technique without interrupting their workflow to glance at a screen.

The mobile application provides a simplified interface optimized for tablet viewing, allowing surgical assistants or residents to monitor the procedure and alert the primary surgeon if concerning trends develop. The mobile app connects to the same data stream as the desktop software but presents only the most critical parameters in large, easy-to-read displays suitable for viewing from across the operating room. This distributed monitoring capability enhances safety by providing redundant oversight—even if the primary surgeon is deeply focused on a technically challenging aspect of the procedure, team members can watch for early warning signs of potential complications.

The corrective guidance algorithm incorporates biomechanical models of pedicle screw insertion developed from extensive cadaver studies. The system understands the expected force profiles for different vertebral levels, bone qualities, and patient demographics. When measured forces deviate from expected patterns—for example, a sudden drop in resistance that might indicate breakthrough into the spinal canal—the system immediately escalates alert levels. Similarly, if torque values become excessive, suggesting that the surgeon is trying to force a probe that has encountered an obstruction, the system recommends backing out and reassessing the trajectory rather than continuing to push forward. These intelligent alerts go beyond simple threshold monitoring to provide context-aware guidance based on the collective knowledge of thousands of successful procedures.

## Technical Implementation and Architecture

The embedded systems architecture balances the competing demands of real-time performance, low power consumption, and compact packaging. A 32-bit ARM Cortex microcontroller serves as the central processor, running custom firmware developed in C++ for maximum execution efficiency. The firmware implements a multi-tasking real-time operating system that manages concurrent operations: sampling the force-torque sensor at 200 Hertz, reading the orientation sensor at 100 Hertz, processing these raw measurements through calibration algorithms and filters, packaging the results into compact data frames, transmitting via Bluetooth, monitoring battery status, and controlling the audio feedback system. Despite this complexity, the firmware maintains deterministic timing with jitter less than 1 millisecond, ensuring that guidance feedback reaches the surgeon without perceptible delay.

Sensor calibration procedures run automatically each time the probe powers on. The force-torque sensor undergoes a zero-offset calibration to compensate for any residual signals when no load is applied, accounting for thermal drift and component aging. The orientation sensor performs a heading calibration that maps the current magnetic field environment to establish a stable reference frame, important given that the operating room contains large metal tables and equipment that distort the Earth's magnetic field. These automatic calibrations take approximately 10 seconds and require no user intervention beyond placing the probe on a flat surface and pressing the power button.

The desktop software application was developed using Python with the Qt framework for the graphical user interface, chosen for its cross-platform compatibility and rapid development cycle. The application architecture separates concerns into distinct modules: a communication layer handles Bluetooth connectivity and data stream parsing, a signal processing layer applies filtering and feature extraction algorithms, a visualization layer renders real-time graphs and 3D probe representations, and a guidance layer implements the decision logic for audio alerts and corrective recommendations. This modular design facilitates testing and validation—each component can be verified independently before integration into the complete system.

The mobile application uses React Native, enabling a single codebase to compile for both iOS and Android platforms. This choice maximized development efficiency while ensuring broad compatibility with the tablets and smartphones surgeons already carry. The mobile app subscribes to a WebSocket data feed from the desktop application, allowing it to display synchronized views of the same sensor data. Push notification capabilities mean the mobile app can alert surgical team members even if they've temporarily switched to a different application—for example, if a resident steps out to check a lab result, they'll receive an urgent notification if critical force thresholds are exceeded during their absence.

Data logging and post-operative analysis features record every aspect of each procedure, creating a comprehensive dataset for quality improvement and research purposes. The system timestamps all sensor readings and user interactions, allowing retrospective reconstruction of exactly what happened at any point during surgery. Anonymized data can be aggregated across multiple procedures to identify trends—for example, do certain surgeons consistently apply higher forces, do breach events correlate with specific force-torque patterns, how does experience level affect probe trajectory control. These insights drive continuous improvement in both the technology and surgical technique.

## Clinical Validation and User Studies

The Smart Pedicle Probe underwent rigorous validation through a multi-phase testing program culminating in demonstration at the Southwest Orthopedic Trauma Association (SWOTA) Conference in 2019. The initial development phase involved extensive benchtop testing using synthetic bone models and cadaveric specimens. Engineers characterized the probe's accuracy by comparing sensor readings to gold-standard laboratory instruments. Force measurements agreed with calibrated load cells to within 0.5 Newtons across the entire operating range. Orientation accuracy was validated using optical motion capture, confirming that the inertial sensors tracked probe angles to within 1.5 degrees even during dynamic movements simulating surgical use.

Cadaver studies provided crucial insights into the relationship between sensor readings and anatomical outcomes. Multiple experienced spine surgeons performed pedicle probe placements in fresh-frozen human cadaver specimens spanning C3 through L5 vertebral levels. After each insertion, the specimens underwent high-resolution CT scanning to assess whether the probe trajectory remained within the pedicle or breached into adjacent structures. Researchers then correlated the CT findings with the recorded sensor data, identifying characteristic signatures associated with safe placements versus breaches. Successful placements showed gradually increasing force as the probe advanced through progressively denser bone, with orientation remaining stable within 3 degrees of the initial trajectory. Breaches exhibited distinct patterns—medial breaches into the spinal canal often showed a sudden force drop as the probe broke through the thin medial cortex, while lateral breaches sometimes revealed increasing torque as the probe deflected against the thicker lateral wall before finally penetrating.

The landmark validation study at SWOTA 2019 involved 27 surgical residents from medical colleges across three states. This represented a diverse sample spanning different training levels from PGY-1 through PGY-5, various fellowship specializations including orthopedic surgery and neurosurgery, and experience with both traditional and minimally invasive techniques. Each resident performed multiple pedicle probe placements in synthetic bone models designed to replicate the challenging anatomy of the cervical spine. Half of the attempts were performed with the Smart Pedicle Probe providing real-time feedback, while the other half used conventional probes without guidance, serving as controls. The order was randomized to eliminate learning effects.

The results demonstrated statistically significant improvements in multiple outcome measures. Trajectory accuracy improved by 35 percent when using the Smart Pedicle Probe compared to conventional techniques, with angular deviations from the planned path averaging 3.2 degrees versus 4.9 degrees without guidance. The rate of simulated breaches—defined as the probe exiting the synthetic pedicle boundaries—decreased from 18 percent in the control group to just 6 percent with real-time feedback, a relative risk reduction of 67 percent. Force control also improved, with guided insertions showing 28 percent less variance in applied force and fewer instances of excessive force application. Perhaps most tellingly, the time required to complete each insertion decreased by 12 percent on average, contradicting the common assumption that additional feedback would slow surgeons down. Instead, the real-time guidance allowed residents to proceed more confidently along safe trajectories rather than making tentative, repeatedly corrected advances that characterized the control attempts.

Post-study surveys revealed high user acceptance. On a scale from 1 to 5, residents rated the helpfulness of real-time force feedback at 4.6, orientation guidance at 4.4, and audio cues at 4.3. Many commented that the audio feedback was particularly valuable because it allowed them to make corrections without breaking visual focus on the surgical field. Several senior residents noted that the quantitative force data helped them better understand the "feel" they had been told to develop through experience—seeing the numbers helped them calibrate their tactile perception. The compact form factor and familiar ergonomics received praise, with 89 percent of participants stating they would use the Smart Pedicle Probe in their future surgical practice if it were available.

## Clinical Applications and Surgical Workflow Integration

The Smart Pedicle Probe integrates seamlessly into existing surgical workflows with minimal disruption to established protocols. Before the operation begins, the surgical team performs standard preoperative planning using CT or MRI scans to determine optimal screw trajectories for each vertebral level requiring instrumentation. These planned trajectories can be imported into the Smart Pedicle Probe software, providing reference angles for the orientation guidance system. The probe itself undergoes standard sterilization procedures—the entire instrument can be autoclaved using conventional steam sterilization cycles, with the battery and electronics sealed in medical-grade waterproof housings that withstand the high temperatures and pressures involved.

In the operating room, setup takes less than two minutes. The probe powers on with a single button press and automatically completes its calibration sequence. A sterile Bluetooth bridge device, placed within the sterile field but outside the immediate surgical area, relays data from the probe to the computer workstation positioned where surgical staff can monitor it without crowding the operative field. The surgeon picks up the Smart Pedicle Probe and performs a reference measurement, touching the probe tip to anatomical landmarks to establish the patient-specific coordinate system. This registration process typically involves identifying the spinous process, transverse processes, and planned entry point, allowing the software to align its internal coordinate frame with the actual patient anatomy.

During the critical insertion phase, the surgeon operates the Smart Pedicle Probe exactly as they would a conventional instrument, using familiar manual techniques to advance the probe through the pedicle. The key difference is the continuous stream of feedback informing their decisions. As the probe tip contacts bone and the surgeon begins applying force, they hear the baseline low-frequency tone indicating normal operation. The visual display shows force rising from zero Newtons toward the typical range of 30 to 50 Newtons used for pedicle perforation. If the surgeon unconsciously begins to angle the probe more laterally than intended—perhaps compensating for patient positioning or surgical approach angle—the audio cueing begins within one second of the deviation exceeding the 5-degree threshold. The rightward bias of the beeping pattern immediately communicates which direction to correct, and the surgeon makes a subtle adjustment to redirect medially. The beeping ceases as soon as the trajectory returns to the safe corridor, providing immediate positive feedback that the correction was successful.

The system proves particularly valuable at the critical moment when the probe tip penetrates through the far cortex of the pedicle. This transition from hard cortical bone to the softer cancellous bone of the vertebral body creates a sudden decrease in resistance that can cause the probe to advance more rapidly than intended. Without feedback, surgeons might continue applying the same force, causing the probe to punch through the anterior vertebral body cortex into the anterior soft tissues. The Smart Pedicle Probe detects the resistance drop through the sudden decrease in measured force and immediately alerts the surgeon with an escalated audio warning. This gives the surgeon a fraction of a second to ease off on the applied force, allowing controlled advancement through the vertebral body rather than an uncontrolled lunge.

For teaching hospitals and residency programs, the Smart Pedicle Probe serves as an invaluable educational tool. Attending surgeons can observe the forces and angles their residents apply, identifying technical errors that might be difficult to see from across the operating table. After the procedure, the recorded data can be reviewed during debriefing sessions, showing residents exactly where they deviated from optimal technique and how their force application patterns compared to more experienced surgeons. This objective feedback accelerates skill development in ways that traditional "see one, do one, teach one" apprenticeship cannot match. Simulation-based training can incorporate the Smart Pedicle Probe, allowing residents to practice on synthetic models while receiving the same real-time feedback they'll experience during actual surgeries, building muscle memory and judgment before encountering their first live patient.

## Safety Features and Fail-Safe Design

Patient safety drives every aspect of the Smart Pedicle Probe's design, with multiple redundant safeguards ensuring that device failure cannot lead to surgical complications. The wireless communication protocol includes comprehensive error detection—each data packet contains checksums that allow the receiving computer to verify data integrity. If corrupted packets are detected, the system immediately alerts the surgical team and can optionally halt guidance feedback until communication is restored, preventing the propagation of false information that could misdirect surgical technique. Battery monitoring provides multiple levels of warning long before power depletion could affect operation. At 30 percent remaining capacity, a non-intrusive icon appears on the display. At 15 percent, the audio system provides a distinct low-priority alert. At 10 percent, the system strongly recommends completing the current insertion and recharging before proceeding to additional levels.

The force-torque sensor incorporates overload protection—mechanical stops prevent damage to the strain gauges even if forces far exceeding the measurement range are applied. This ensures that the sensor will return to accurate operation after unusual events rather than requiring recalibration or replacement. The orientation sensor uses multiple independent measurement modalities (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer), and the firmware continuously cross-checks these readings for consistency. If the sensors disagree beyond expected noise levels, suggesting a hardware fault, the system alerts users that orientation data may be unreliable and disables orientation-based guidance rather than providing potentially incorrect directional cues.

Software safeguards include boundary checking on all sensor inputs—physically impossible values are rejected rather than displayed, preventing spurious readings from causing confusion or inappropriate alerts. The guidance algorithms incorporate hysteresis to prevent chattering or oscillation of alerts when measurements hover near threshold values. For example, if the force exceeds the recommended maximum, triggering a high-force alert, the force must drop at least 5 Newtons below the threshold before the alert clears. This prevents the annoying and potentially dangerous situation where an alert rapidly turns on and off as measurements fluctuate around the boundary, possibly causing surgeons to ignore or disable the alert system.

Fail-safe principles dictate that any system failure should bias toward safety. Loss of wireless communication doesn't disable the probe—it continues to function as a conventional manual instrument, allowing the surgeon to complete the insertion using traditional tactile feedback. However, the loss of guidance is immediately obvious through both the disappearance of the audio tone and prominent visual indicators on all displays, ensuring that surgeons don't mistakenly believe they're receiving feedback when they're actually operating without guidance. Similarly, if the software application crashes, the probe continues operating and attempting to transmit data, so that when the application restarts, data logging can resume with minimal interruption. These design choices reflect a fundamental principle: the Smart Pedicle Probe augments surgical capability but never becomes a critical dependency whose failure would force abortion of the procedure.

## Future Directions and Advanced Capabilities

The current Smart Pedicle Probe represents a strong foundation for future enhancements that could further improve surgical outcomes and expand applications. Near-term developments include integration with intraoperative navigation systems commonly used in spine surgery. By combining the Smart Pedicle Probe's force and orientation data with the positional information from optical or electromagnetic tracking, surgeons would receive a complete picture of where the probe is located, which direction it's pointing, how hard they're pushing, and whether the trajectory will reach the intended target. This fusion of complementary technologies provides redundant confirmation of safe placement—even if one system experiences errors, the other serves as a backup.

Machine learning algorithms could analyze the accumulated database of thousands of insertions to develop more sophisticated predictive models. Rather than simply alerting when thresholds are exceeded, future versions might provide anticipatory guidance: "Based on the current trajectory and force application rate, if you continue along this path, there's an 80 percent probability of lateral cortex breach within the next 3 millimeters of advancement." This forward-looking intelligence would give surgeons even more time to make corrective adjustments. Pattern recognition algorithms might identify individual surgeon techniques and provide personalized feedback: "Your force application in the cervical spine tends to be 20 percent higher than optimal; try reducing force slightly."

Haptic feedback represents an exciting frontier. Future probes might incorporate small motors that generate vibrations or resistance forces in the handle, providing tactile cues in addition to audio and visual feedback. When the probe deviates from the safe corridor, a pulsing vibration could alert the surgeon through their sense of touch, leveraging another sensory channel for redundant communication. Active resistance feedback could make it physically more difficult to advance the probe in unsafe directions—the handle could push back against lateral movements when the probe is angling toward the spinal canal, providing intuitive physical guidance that requires no conscious interpretation of signals.

Expanding applications beyond pedicle screw placement could bring Smart Pedicle Probe technology to other challenging surgical procedures. Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, procedures where cement is injected into fractured vertebral bodies, require precise needle placement through the pedicle. The Smart Pedicle Probe could guide these insertions while additionally monitoring injection pressure to prevent dangerous cement extravasation into the spinal canal. Sacroiliac joint fusion procedures involve drilling across the sacroiliac joint, a narrow target surrounded by neurovascular structures where guidance would improve safety and success rates. Even non-orthopedic applications exist—neurosurgeons placing deep brain stimulation electrodes or performing stereotactic biopsies could benefit from real-time force feedback indicating when the probe tip transitions between different brain tissue types.

Miniaturization efforts could produce pediatric versions of the Smart Pedicle Probe, scaled down to accommodate the smaller anatomy of children undergoing scoliosis correction or other spinal instrumentation. The fundamental sensor technologies scale well to smaller sizes, though power management becomes more challenging as battery capacity decreases with volume. Alternatively, external power delivery through transcutaneous coupling might eliminate battery constraints entirely for procedures lasting longer than current battery life supports.

Wireless charging enhancements could streamline the recharging process. Rather than a dedicated charging dock, the probe could charge when placed in any special tray lined with wireless charging coils. Multiple probes could charge simultaneously without alignment requirements, simplifying workflow in busy surgical suites where multiple procedures occur daily. Fast-charging capabilities could reduce the recharge time from the current hour down to 15-20 minutes, making it feasible to recharge between cases even during a packed surgical schedule.

## Conclusion and Broader Impact

The Smart Pedicle Probe demonstrates how thoughtful integration of sensing technology, wireless communication, and intuitive human interfaces can meaningfully improve surgical outcomes and safety. By providing surgeons with quantitative real-time feedback about forces, torques, and orientations that they previously could only estimate from experience and tactile perception, the system makes optimal technique accessible to surgeons at all experience levels. The documented improvements in trajectory accuracy, reduction in breach rates, and positive user feedback from the SWOTA 2019 validation study confirm that this technology addresses real clinical needs in practical, workflow-compatible ways.

The broader impact extends beyond individual patient outcomes to affect surgical training, quality assurance, and the continued evolution of spinal surgical techniques. Objective data from thousands of procedures will reveal best practices and help standardize approaches that minimize complications. Residents accelerate their skill development through immediate feedback that previously took years of experience to internalize. Hospitals can demonstrate quality metrics and monitor surgeon performance across their orthopedic and neurosurgical departments. As the database grows, patterns may emerge suggesting optimal strategies for specific patient populations or anatomical variants, contributing to the broader scientific understanding of spine biomechanics.

The Smart Pedicle Probe exemplifies a design philosophy applicable throughout medical device development: start with a deep understanding of clinical workflow and user needs, integrate sensors and intelligence in ways that augment rather than replace human expertise, communicate information through multiple sensory channels to match how humans actually work in high-stress environments, and never sacrifice the simplicity and reliability that medical professionals demand. This project proves that significant improvements in surgical safety and outcomes need not require revolutionary new approaches or massively expensive technologies—sometimes the most impactful innovations come from thoughtfully applying existing technologies to solve well-defined clinical problems. The success of the Smart Pedicle Probe paves the way for similar intelligent surgical instruments across medical specialties, bringing quantitative guidance and enhanced safety to procedures throughout modern healthcare.
