# Interactive BCI Technology for Quadriplegic and Cerebral Palsy Patients

## Overview

Developed an end-to-end **EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)** platform tailored for patients with **quadriplegia** and **cerebral palsy**. The system integrates **signal acquisition, real-time classification, adaptive UI rendering, and caregiver notification** through a custom Android app called **β-ATNotifier**.

💡 **Key Innovation**: Low-cost, clinically deployable BCI system that allows users to select commands from a screen using only brain signals—no physical movement required.

## The Problem

### Patient Populations

**Quadriplegia:**
- Complete or partial paralysis of all four limbs
- Loss of voluntary motor control below the neck
- Unable to use traditional assistive devices (keyboards, switches)
- Severe communication limitations

**Cerebral Palsy:**
- Impaired muscle coordination and movement
- Speech difficulties in severe cases
- Limited or no ability to use conventional input devices
- Difficulty expressing basic needs

### Communication Barrier

**Critical needs that cannot be communicated:**
- "Need Assistance"
- "Call Nurse"
- "Water"
- "Pain"
- "Emergency"

**Current solutions inadequate:**
- Eye-gaze systems expensive (greater than $10,000)
- Switch-based devices require residual motor control
- Voice recognition fails with speech impairments
- Caregiver must constantly monitor patient

- Works for patients with limited motor imagery ability

**Challenges:**
- Slower selection time (3-6 seconds)
- Requires visual attention capability

### 3. Steady-State Visually Evoked Potential (SSVEP)

**Principle**: Visual cortex resonates at frequency of flickering stimulus

**Implementation:**
