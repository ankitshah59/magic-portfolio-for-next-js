## Overview

This study presents a **non-invasive, wireless smart textile band** designed specifically for continuous health monitoring in horses. The device tracks respiratory activity, cardiac function, and movement in real-time without requiring hair removal—addressing a critical gap in equine healthcare where nearly **80% of racehorses suffer from asthma** but lack practical long-term monitoring solutions.

💡 **Key Innovation**: First field-deployable, hair-coat-tolerant wearable system for equines that enables continuous physiological monitoring during natural behavior, validated against clinical gold standards.
