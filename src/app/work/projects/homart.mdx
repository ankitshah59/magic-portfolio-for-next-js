## Overview

HoMart is a comprehensive smart kitchen assistant that combines **hardware sensing, software intelligence, and mobile connectivity** to help users track groceries, monitor expiry, analyze consumption, and control kitchen appliances remotely. It automates kitchen management while promoting smarter shopping habits.

---

## Hardware Architecture

The core of HoMart is the **Smart Kitchen Device**, which consists of:

1. **Load Cells / Weight Sensors**  
   - High-precision load cells measure the weight of groceries placed on shelves, drawers, or storage containers.  
   - The sensors are connected to a **microcontroller (ESP32 / Arduino)** for data acquisition.  
   - Each load cell is calibrated to detect even small changes in weight (e.g., 50g granularity).

2. **Microcontroller Unit (MCU)**  
   - ESP32 is preferred for its built-in **Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities**.  
   - It reads sensor data via an **HX711 amplifier module** (standard for load cells) and transmits data to the cloud.  
   - The MCU handles **threshold checking**, expiry detection, and local alerts.

3. **Relay Modules / Smart Switches**  
   - Control kitchen appliances remotely (coffee maker, lights, toaster, etc.).  
   - Microcontroller sends control signals to relays or smart plugs based on user input from the app.

4. **Power Supply**  
   - 5V/12V regulated power supply depending on sensor and relay requirements.  
   - Battery backup optional for uninterrupted monitoring.

## Software Architecture

### Embedded Software (Smart Kitchen Device)
- **Sensor Reading**:  
  - Load cell readings are collected every few seconds and averaged to reduce noise.  
  - Weight changes trigger local logic for expiry alerts or low-stock notifications.
  
- **Data Transmission**:  
  - Wi-Fi module sends JSON payloads of grocery weights and timestamps to a **cloud server** via **HTTP REST API or MQTT**.  
  - For offline use, data is buffered on the device until connectivity is restored.

- **Appliance Control Logic**:  
  - MCU receives commands from the cloud to switch appliances ON/OFF.  
  - Optional timer functions allow scheduled appliance operations.

---

### Mobile App (Android)
1. **Frontend**:  
   - Built using **Flutter** (cross-platform) or **native Android (Kotlin)**.  
   - Displays real-time grocery weight, shopping list, consumption graphs, and appliance status.

2. **Backend Integration**:  
   - Cloud database (Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore) stores historical weight data, thresholds, expiry dates, and user preferences.  
   - REST API or MQTT server facilitates **bi-directional communication** between app and Smart Kitchen Device.

3. **Features**:  
   - **Notifications**: Alerts when groceries are low or near expiry.  
   - **Shopping Cart Sync**: Items automatically added to shopping wish list when weight drops below threshold.  
   - **Consumption Analysis**: Weekly graphs visualize consumption trends.  
   - **Voice Commands**: Integrated with Google Speech API; users can say “Add milk” to update the shopping list.  
   - **Appliance Control**: Users can remotely switch appliances on/off or set timers.

## Data Processing & Intelligence

- **Threshold Alerts**: User-defined minimum weights trigger notifications.  
- **Expiry Detection**: Changes in weight over time are compared to user-defined expiry durations.  
- **Consumption Analytics**:  
  - Daily/weekly summaries generated by aggregating sensor data.  
  - Graphs indicate frequently used items, rarely used items, and consumption patterns for smart shopping.

---

## Connectivity & Cloud

- **Communication Protocols**:  
  - MQTT for lightweight, low-latency updates.  
  - HTTP REST API for app-cloud-device sync.  

- **Cloud Storage**:  
  - Firebase or AWS DynamoDB stores user data, device data, and appliance schedules.  
  - Optional integration with **Google Calendar** or **shopping apps** for notifications.

- **Security**:  
  - HTTPS / SSL encryption for all communication.  
  - User authentication via OAuth2 or Firebase Auth.

---

## DIY Implementation Summary

1. **Assemble Smart Kitchen Device**:  
   - Mount load cells on shelves or containers.  
   - Connect HX711 module to ESP32 MCU.  
   - Attach relay modules for appliances.  
   - Connect to Wi-Fi and test weight readings.

2. **Develop Embedded Firmware**:  
   - Read sensor data, detect threshold changes, and transmit to cloud.  
   - Implement appliance control logic.

3. **Set Up Cloud & Database**:  
   - Firebase or AWS backend with user accounts and grocery records.  
   - APIs to receive sensor data and send control commands.

4. **Build Mobile App**:  
   - Design UI for grocery tracking, alerts, analytics, and appliance control.  
   - Connect app to cloud backend with REST/MQTT.

5. **Integrate Analytics & Notifications**:  
   - Compute weekly consumption, detect low-stock, and expiry alerts.  
   - Implement push notifications to mobile app.

---

## Outcome

HoMart successfully integrates **hardware sensing, real-time communication, cloud computing, and app intelligence** into one cohesive smart kitchen solution. Users can:  

- Track grocery inventory automatically.  
- Receive notifications for low-stock or expiring items.  
- Analyze weekly consumption for smarter shopping.  
- Control kitchen appliances remotely.  
- Use voice commands to manage shopping lists.  

This project demonstrates a full-stack **IoT + mobile app solution**, combining embedded systems, cloud computing, data analytics, and human-centric design.
