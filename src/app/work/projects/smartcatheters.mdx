## The Problem: Why Current Catheters Fall Short

### Clinical Need

Catheters are foundational tools in minimally invasive medicine:
- **Cardiac catheterization**: Coronary artery evaluation
- **Vascular surgery**: Stent placement
- **Oncology**: Localized drug delivery
- **Urology**: Drainage and monitoring

**Critical Gap**: Most catheters remain fundamentally **passive conduits** lacking sensing or actuating functions, limiting their ability to provide real-time feedback or adapt to physiological conditions.

### Limitations of Current Approaches

**Traditional Planar Microfabrication:**
- Electronics fabricated on flat films via photolithography
- Films wrapped or bonded onto curved catheter surfaces
- **Major problems:**
  - Delamination during bending/inflation
  - Buckling and creasing under strain
  - Stress concentrations causing sensor failure
  - Poor conformity to small-diameter catheters (2-6 mm)
  - Intermediate adhesives create failure points
  - Labor-intensive multi-step assembly
  - Difficult to scale for manufacturing

**Existing Printed Solutions:**
- **Aerosol jet printing**: Non-contact but requires specialized atomizers, limited material range
- **Inkjet printing**: Fine features but struggles with high-viscosity inks
- **Open-loop systems**: Assume idealized cylindrical substrates, fail with real-world irregularities
- **Commercial 6-axis robots**: Complex setup, limited to 180° surface coverage, requires rigid substrates

**The Core Issue**: No practical system exists for conformal, high-fidelity printing on flexible, deformable cylindrical medical devices.
